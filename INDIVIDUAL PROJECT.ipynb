    "### Analysis 1: The Correlation Between American Politics and Stock Market Changes\n",
    "(a) **Variables**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Major Political Events in the United States (e.g., elections TRUMP ? MUSK!!!! )\n",
    "- Stock Market Indices (e.g., S&P 500, Dow Jones)  \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) **Analysis**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Perform a time series analysis and linear regression to examine how major political events in the U.S. correlate with changes in the stock market. Use descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median to understand stock market behavior during these events. Calculate correlation coefficients to determine the strength of the relationship between political events and market changes. Hypothesis testing can also be conducted to assess the significance of observed trends. Use event study methodology to capture market responses to significant political milestones, complemented by visualizations like line charts and volatility plots. Assumptions include considering that no major global economic crisis or other confounding factors occur during the period of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Results**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis may reveal that specific political events, such as elections or policy announcements, trigger spikes or drops in the stock market. Alternatively, some events may show little effect, indicating market stability despite political shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance**: \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis provides insights into how political events shape economic sentiment and investment decisions. Understanding statistical measures like correlation, mean shifts, and standard deviations can help quantify the impact of political events on the market. These insights can help investors and policymakers anticipate and respond to market movements during politically significant times, making better-informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- H0: Major political events, such as presidential elections, have no effect on stock market volatility.\n",
    "- H1: Major political events, such as presidential elections, have effect on stock market volatility.uncertainty and changes in investor sentiment.\n",

    "### Analysis 2: The Impact of War on Global Trade in the Clothing Industry\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) **Variables**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Major Global Conflicts (e.g., war events)\n",
    "- Clothing Trade Metrics (e.g., export/import volumes)  \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) **Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use historical data to conduct a comparative analysis of global clothing trade before, during, and after major conflicts. Calculate means and standard deviations of trade metrics to observe changes in trade volumes. Conduct hypothesis testing to determine whether significant changes occurred in trade metrics during conflict periods. Use visualizations such as trade flow maps and bar charts to assess the impact of wars on clothing trade metrics. Assumptions include the availability and accuracy of trade data across the selected periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Results**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The results may indicate a sharp decline in clothing trade during periods of conflict, highlighting disrupted supply chains and trade routes. Alternatively, some countries might demonstrate resilience or adaptation strategies that mitigate trade impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance**: \n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding how wars influence global trade in clothing, we can identify vulnerabilities and develop strategies to strengthen supply chains. Utilizing statistical measures like standard deviation and hypothesis testing helps quantify the impact of conflicts on trade and evaluate the resilience of different regions or countries. This aligns with the projectâ€™s objective of analyzing economic disruptions and their broader implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- H0: Major global conflicts have no significant effect on clothing trade (export/import volumes and trade routes).\n",
    "- H1: Major global conflicts significantly disrupt clothing trade \n",

    "### Analysis 3: The Relationship Between Food Prices and Working Hours\n",
    "(a) **Variables**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average Food Prices\n",
    "- Average Hours Worked per Week \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) **Analysis**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct a correlation analysis to explore the relationship between changes in food prices and the average number of hours worked. Calculate statistical measures like mean, median, and standard deviation for both food prices and working hours. Perform a linear regression to determine how much of the variation in working hours can be explained by changes in food prices. Use visualizations like scatter plots and trend lines to illustrate potential relationships between economic stress (food prices) and labor responses (working hours). Assumptions include that the data is collected consistently across different regions and economic contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Results**: \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis may show that increasing food prices lead to longer working hours as people strive to meet rising living costs. Alternatively, the relationship could be weak, suggesting that other factors, such as government subsidies or social programs, play a larger role.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this relationship can provide key insights into how economic pressures affect labor behavior. Using statistical tools such as correlation coefficients and regression analysis helps quantify the impact of rising food prices on working hours. This is crucial for developing policies aimed at supporting workers during times of economic stress, aligning with the course project's focus on socioeconomic dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- H0: There is no correlation between rising food prices and the increase in average working hours.\n",
    "- H1: Rising food prices lead to an increase in average working hours "
